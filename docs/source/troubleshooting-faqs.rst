FAQs
------------

**Is there a way to switch CounterSocial to a light background?**
	**A:** Yes, dark and light themes are available for both desktop and official mobile app users.  `Click here <https://help.counter.social/en/latest/accessibility.html#light-dark-mode>`_ for information about site themeing options.

 |
**The Desktop version is too busy for me? Is there a way to turn off features?**
	**A:** We understand that CoSo on the desktop can be overwhelming. Go to Edit Profile > Preferences and enable Ostrich Mode to remove the MSNBC news ticker, COSOTV channel selector, COSOCOM radio scanner, Network Sentiment Meter, and Trending Hashtags. Note: We are aware of a bug that causes some users to lose Ostrich Mode after logging out of CounterSocial. If this happens, simply revisit your preferences to reactivate this feature.

 |
**Where are the GIFS?**
	**A:** CounterSocial does not have a built-in GIF search engine. To post GIFs, save them from your favorite GIF dealer and upload them the same as you would any image or video. Tenor.com, Giphy.com, and Google Image Search are just a few of the many resources for animated content.  `Click here <https://help.counter.social/en/latest/posting-content.html#attaching-media-files>`_ to learn more about supported file types and instructions on attaching media and files to your posts. 

 |
**When I upload an image, it's upside down or on its side. How do I fix this?**
	**A:** To protect your privacy, CounterSocial automatically scrubs all meta-data from your media files including photo orientation. If you upload an image and it is not oriented correctly, use the delete & redraft option to edit your post. Make a minor edit to the original image file, save it, and re-upload to correct the issue.

 |
**What is SANITIZER and why don't some of my links work?**
	**A:** Sanitizer is a core CounterSocial security feature and serves two purposes. First, it strips all personally identifiable tags from posted URLs. Second, it removes all metadata from uploaded media. If you'd like to post a URL and preserve the original link tags, add the term **"nosanitize"** (without quote) anywhere in the post to turn off the sanitizer. The most common use case is time-stamped youtube links. 

 |
**Is there a way to import or auto-follow friends from Twitter or my phone contacts?**
	**A:** No. CounterSocial will never scan your phone contacts or data-mine your followers from other platforms. 

 |
**Help! I've accidently unpinned the Community Firehose. How do I get it back?**
	**A:** Click on the CounterSocial in the upper-left corner of the page to reset your layout. Next, click on the "Community Firehose" link in the navigation column. To re-pin it to your layout, open the settings icon at the top of the column and selet "+Pin." 

 |
**When I try to publish my post, the post button doesn't work. What am I doing wrong?**
	**A:** There are multiple issues that cause this problem. 
 |1. You have exceeded the maximum character count of 500.
 |2. Your post may contain special characters that resemble programming code that hackers use to exploit systems. Check for odd punctionation combinations such as brackets [], currency symbols $, and/or quotations "" and, if found, make some adjustments.
 |3. CounterSocial may be experiencing intermittent issues. If the solutions above are not the issue, refresh the page to try again. 

 |
**When I upload my image/video/gif, it doesn't attach to the post. What's the problem?**
	**A:** It's likely you are uploading media over the maximum allowable sizes of 8MB for images and 40MB for audio/video, or are uploading an unsupported file type. `Click Here <https://help.counter.social/en/latest/posting-content.html#editing-media>`_ to learn more about sharing image and video files. 

 |
**I am missing columns or features from the Desktop version. Where are they?**
	**A:** CoSo is optimized to fit the device or screen resolution specified in your computer's display settings. In the case where the resolution is low or you are on a small screen, the layout will automatically drop non-essential items to fit core elements in the space. This may include items such as your avatar and "edit profile" link, the CounterShare button in the Navigation column, or the News broadcast and CoSoCom players on the bottom left. To check if this the case, hold down the CTRL/CMD key while pressing - (minus) to zoom out or + (plus) to zoom back in. This is a temporary issue while CoSo evolves to be responsive on all screens and devices.

 |
**I am having problems with my PRO subscription. How do I get help?**
	**A:** You can manage most issues including billing updates, renewals, and/or cancellations through the `PRO Account Portal <https://counter.social/accmgt/getpro.php/>`_. For your security and privacy, all PRO subscriptions are handled by a seperate payment processor. While your email address links your PRO account to CoSo, it is possible to have different passwords. If you are having access issues, use the "Forgot Password" link below the login fields in the PRO Subscription Portal. For all other issues, please email **payments(@)counter.social** and allow 24 hours for a reply.

 |
**Where do I find Keyboard Shortcuts?**
	**A:** On a desktop browser, press the question mark (?) key. If you are on a mobile device, swipe left.

 |
**How does the algorithm work here?**
	**A:** It's actually very simple. There isn't one.

 |
**There is a strange audio emanating from CounterSocial that sounds like an emergency scanner and I don't know where it's coming from. Help!**
	**A:** This sound is likely coming from CoSoCom, CounterSocial's emergency broadcast scanner located at the bottom left corner of the desktop version. On rare occassions, it is set to "play" when you load the page for the first time. If this happens to you, simple click the blue circle on the display (it resembles a "stop" button) to turn it off.
