PRO Features

PRO vs Basic Subscriptions
------------
CounterSocial is 100% community-funded, primarily through a PRO subscription that unlocks additional tools and features. A PRO subscription is not required to participate and enjoy the core CoSo experience. However, at about the price of a fancy cup of coffee per month, the increased privacy, security, zero spam, and ad-free experience is well worth the price to keep the servers running every month. For now, PRO subscriptions are charged monthly and cannot be paid in advance or gifted to other users.

How to Upgrade to PRO
------------

CoSoPro subscriptions are processed through an established and secure 3rd-party payments processor and are managed through the `PRO Subscription Portal <https://counter.social/accmgt/getpro.php>`_. Once signed-up, CounterSocial verifies your status using the email address you have provided.

#. Visit the `PRO Subscription Portal <https://counter.social/accmgt/getpro.php>`_ or navigate to the CoSoPro link in the right-column navigation menu.
#. Click the neon green “Upgrade Me” button.
#. It is important that you use the SAME email you used to sign up for CoSo to sign up for the PRO Portal so CoSo can verify your status. There is no retrieval system to locate the email address you used to sign up. A page will open asking you to acknowledge this requirement.
#. Click on “Continue to Payment” to be redirected to our 3rd party payment gateway.
#. Follow the prompts and continue to activate your subscription. U.S. citizens or legal residents of the U.S. can add an extra layer of privacy, not just for your CoSo subscription for any online transactions with Privacy.com, a virtual card that can mask your name, address, and credit card information.
#. Keep your username and password in a safe place.

 
 **Thank you for going PRO**

 .. attention:: After your subscription is complete, return to Counter.Social and log out. Once you log back in, the platform will check your status and activate your PRO features. In some cases, this can take a few minutes and require you to reset your browser’s cookies or refresh your cache.
