Welcome to the CounterSocial User Guide
===================================

**CounterSocial** is a next-gen social network system built to counter threats found on traditional mainstream platforms including bots, trolls, disinformation campaigns, and foreign influence operations. Launched in 2017 by an American patriot/hacktivist named 'The Jester' (aka th3j35t3r or JΞSŦΞR ✪ ΔCŦUΔL³³º¹), it is the first social network to take an active, zero-tolerance stance against adversarial nations engaged in influence operations by blocking the IP ranges of abusive countries, TOR nodes, VPNs, and proxies.
